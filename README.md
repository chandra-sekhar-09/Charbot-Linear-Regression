# Python Chatbot & Linear Regression Project

## 📌 Overview
This project contains two mini-tasks:
1. **Python Chatbot** – A simple rule-based chatbot built using Python, NumPy, and Regular Expressions.  
2. **Linear Regression Model** – A basic machine learning model that studies the relationship between advertising spend and sales.

Both tasks are designed to strengthen Python fundamentals, data handling, visualization, and model-building skills.

## 🧠 Task 1: Python Chatbot
- Uses pattern matching with **Regular Expressions (re module)**  
- Generates random responses using **NumPy**  
- Interacts with users in real time  
- Helps understand the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### 💡 Features
- Responds to greetings and common conversational patterns  
- Simple pattern-based dataset  
- Easy to extend with more responses  

---

## 📊 Task 2: Linear Regression
- Uses **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **scikit-learn**  
- Demonstrates how advertising spend influences sales  
- Plots scatter diagrams and regression lines  
- Outputs slope and intercept of the best-fit line

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Regular Expressions  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- scikit-learn
